        <h2 id="Starting_out">Starting out</h2>
        <article>
          If you're just starting out, get a feel of making a website by
          watching some tutorials. Start installing the required software in web
          developing such as a code editor and a browser and other software
          needed.
        </article>

        <h2 id="HTML">Study HTML</h2>
        <article>
          Start with HTML. HTML is the backbone or skeleton of a website. It
          serves as the foundation of the website. Watch some tutorials on
          YouTube like Bro Code HTML or Mosh or go finish some HTML courses
          online to understand and study HTML like W3schools.
        </article>

        <h2 id="CSS">Study CSS</h2>
        <article>
          And then go CSS. Now that you know how HTML works, work on studying
          CSS. It is how you will design your website by giving it colors and
          formatting it and such. How you design a website is by CSS. Again just
          watch Bro Code CSS or something on YouTube and do an online free
          course online like W3schools.
        </article>

        <h2 id="Javascript">Study Javascript</h2>
        <article>
          Onwards with Javascript. Now that you got a feel for HTML and CSS,
          it's time to study how Javascript works. Javascript is used to add
          functionality to your website. It's used to add buttons and make your
          website move and think and be interactive. This is a little tougher
          than HTML and CSS but you'll make it through. Go watch YouTube
          tutorials and study online courses as well with Bro Code and/or
          W3schools.
        </article>

        <h2 id="Others">Study other web-based stuff.</h2>
        <article>
          Now that you've learned the big three of web dev(HTMl, CSS, and JS),
          your road opens up to more possibilities in the web dev world. You can
          improve your front-end skills by studying more of the big three, do
          UI/UX design, or study back-end web development. The choice is yours.
          Go watch YouTube or study an online course to see what you want to do.
        </article>

        <h2 id="WebDev">Go Dev the Web</h2>
        <article>
          Now that you know how stuff works, make some stuff work. Go make your
          own websites to practice. Make your own projects or get a web-dev job
          or internship. The choice is yours to make. Go Dev the Web.
