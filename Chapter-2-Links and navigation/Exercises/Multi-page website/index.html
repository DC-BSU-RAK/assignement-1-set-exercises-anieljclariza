      <p>
        In March 1945, American bombers destroy most of Kobe during the waning
        days of the Pacific War. Children of an Imperial Japanese Navy captain,
        Seita and his sister Setsuko, survive, but their mother dies. Seita
        conceals their mother's death from Setsuko. The siblings move in with a
        distant aunt, and Seita retrieves supplies he buried before the bombing
        and gives everything to his aunt, save for a tin of Sakuma drops, which
        he gives to Setsuko. The aunt convinces Seita to sell his mother's silk
        kimonos for rice, which devastates Setsuko.
      </p>
      <p>
        As rations shrink, the aunt becomes resentful of the children as Seita
        does nothing to earn the food she prepares for them. At her suggestion,
        Seita withdraws some money from his mother's bank account to buy a
        charcoal stove and other supplies. Following an air raid, the siblings
        move into an abandoned bomb shelter. They capture fireflies from the
        marshes and release them into the refuge for light. The following
        morning the fireflies have died. Setsuko buries them and reveals their
        aunt told her their mother died, then tearfully asks why the fireflies
        had to die so soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things become grim when they run out of rice and a friendly farmer
        insists that Seita swallow his pride and return to their aunt as they
        can't survive alone. Seita steals crops from farms and breaks into
        people's homes during air raids. A farmer catches and beats him, but a
        police officer sympathizes with Seita as he is only stealing to feed
        Setsuko.
      </p>
      <p>
        Setsuko falls ill, and a doctor explains she is suffering malnutrition.
        Seita withdraws the last of the money from their mother's bank account.
        He is distraught to learn that Japan has surrendered and that his father
        is most likely dead, as most of Japan's naval fleet have been sunk.
        Seita returns to Setsuko with food and finds her hallucinating. She dies
        as Seita finishes preparing the food. Seita cremates Setsuko's body and
        her doll in a straw casket. He carries her ashes in the candy tin along
        with his father's photograph.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seita dies of starvation a few weeks later at a Sannomiya train station
        surrounded by other malnourished people. A janitor, tasked with removing
        the bodies before the Americans' arrival, sorts through Seita's
        possessions. He finds the candy tin and throws it into a field.
        Setsuko's ashes spread out, and her spirit springs from the container
        and is joined by Seita's spirit and a cloud of fireflies. The two board
        a ghostly train and, throughout the journey, look back at the events
        leading to Seita's death as silent, passive observers.[a] Their spirits
        arrive at their destination: a hilltop bench overlooking present-day
        Kobe, surrounded by fireflies, healthy and content.
