        Grave of the Fireflies (Japanese: 火垂るの墓, Hepburn: Hotaru no Haka)
        is a 1988 Japanese animated historical war drama film written and
        directed by Isao Takahata, and produced by Studio Ghibli. It is based on
        the 1967 semi-autobiographical short story of the same name by Akiyuki
        Nosaka. Set in the city of Kobe, Japan, it tells the story of siblings
        and war orphans Seita and Setsuko, and their desperate struggle to
        survive during the final months of the Pacific War.
